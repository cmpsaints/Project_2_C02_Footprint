# Project_2_CO2_Footprint

a logging app to track the CO2 carbon footprint generated by the food eat

Build with:

(major libraries/technologies)

- Node
- Express
- MySQL
- Body-Parser
- Bootstrap
- Ejs
- HighCharts
- EasyPieChart

(minor libraries)

- Particles.js
- Switchery

Some Notes:

- Spent way too much time on the front-end.
- Had trouble with the back-end of this. Back-end is not fully implemented. Take a look at the code to see what was worked on. (Eventually used dummy values to test and present graphs.)
- \*\* To view pages, open html files in /public. Html was used during development, because I was attempting for a single-page app. Eventually was to be refactored for Ejs for final push. But really there would not be much diff btwn Html & Ejs for this because it's a single-page app. \*\*
